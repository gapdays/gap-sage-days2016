The first week of the 3rd GAP Days is a school on representation
theory of algebras and homological algebra in GAP. The talks will
provide

* a general introduction to programming in GAP, talks given by
[Max Horn](http://www.quendi.de/math.php), 
* an introduction to parallel programming in GAP, talks given by
[Markus Pfeiffer](http://www.morphism.de/~markusp/), 
* an introduction to the GAP-package [homalg/CAP](http://homalg.math.rwth-aachen.de/)
(homological algebra and category theory in GAP), talks given by
[Mohamed Barakat](http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~barakat/en/index), [Sebastian
Gutsche](http://wwwb.math.rwth-aachen.de/~gutsche/) and [Sebastian Posur](http://wwwb.math.rwth-aachen.de/Mitarbeiter/posur.php), 
* an introduction to the GAP-package [QPA](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oyvinso/QPA/) (Quivers and Path
Algebras), talks given by
[Øystein Skartsæterhagen](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oysteini/) and
[Øyvind Solberg](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oyvinso/),
* an introduction to finding quivers and relations of group rings of
  finite groups, talk given by [Klaus Lux](http://math.arizona.edu/~klux/). 

The school will be followed by a coding sprint to mutally integrate
the homalg/CAP and QPA. It will end on Wednesday the 23rd at 13:00.

* Please install GAP on your laptop _before_ arriving to the school.
Please visit the ["Downloading and Installation" page](http://www.gap-system.org/Download/index.html).

* If you are interested in HPC-GAP (High Performance Computing GAP)
please try to get it installed and working on your laptop
_before_ arriving at the school.
To do so, we suggest following [Reimer's build guide](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/wiki/Building-HPC-GAP).
If you encounter any difficulties, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues)
to report your problem (please include OS version, compiler version, ...).

* The third talk about homalg/CAP will be an interactive hands-on session.
If you are interested in this, please download the latest version of the
[CAP project](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project).
