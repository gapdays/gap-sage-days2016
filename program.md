#### Please look at [the Wiki for details](https://github.com/gapdays/gap-sage-days2016/wiki).

The focus of the GAP-Sage Math workshop will be on improving GAP-SageMath integration and interaction between our systems and between their developers. Topics may include (but will not be limited to):

* better support of libGAP by GAP developers and adaptation of libGAP to HPC-GAP

* adding more GAP packages to the GAP distribution provided with Sage

* discussions on future directions, etc. 

If you have any suggestions for the program, please let the organisers know. 

The workshop wll be preceded by a GAP coding sprint. The focus of the GAP Coding Sprint will be on converging GAP and HPC-GAP development branches. If you have any suggestions for the coding sprint, please let the organisers know or [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues) using the label "gapdays2016". 

## GAP Coding Sprint
* Location: School of Computer Science
* Rooms: Wednesday - 1.04 and 1.33A; Thursday and Friday - 1.04 and 1.33B 
* Start: Wednesday January 13th at 10am (coffee from 9.30am)
* Finish: Saturday January 16th (afternoon)

For those who will stay for GAP-SageMath Days, there will be access to the building, as well as suggestions for exploring St Andrews and surrounding area.


## GAP-SageMath Days
* Location: School of Computer Science
* Rooms: Monday - 1.04 and 1.33B; Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - 1.04 and 1.33A; Friday - 1.04 and 1.33B

* a general introduction to programming in GAP, talks given by
[Max Horn](http://www.quendi.de/math.php), 
* an introduction to parallel programming in GAP, talks given by
[Markus Pfeiffer](http://www.morphism.de/~markusp/), 
* an introduction to the GAP-package [homalg/CAP](http://homalg.math.rwth-aachen.de/)
(homological algebra and category theory in GAP), talks given by
[Mohamed Barakat](http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~barakat/en/index), [Sebastian
Gutsche](http://wwwb.math.rwth-aachen.de/~gutsche/) and [Sebastian Posur](http://wwwb.math.rwth-aachen.de/Mitarbeiter/posur.php), 
* an introduction to the GAP-package [QPA](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oyvinso/QPA/) (Quivers and Path
Algebras), talks given by
[Øystein Skartsæterhagen](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oysteini/) and
[Øyvind Solberg](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oyvinso/),
* an introduction to finding quivers and relations of group rings of
  finite groups, talk given by [Klaus Lux](http://math.arizona.edu/~klux/). 

The school will be followed by a coding sprint to mutally integrate
the homalg/CAP and QPA. It will end on Wednesday the 23rd at 13:00.


*  [Schedule as PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/program.pdf)
  * Welcoming session: Monday, September 14, 09:00
  * First talk: Monday, September 14, 09:15
  * Joint dinner: Wednesday 16, excursion in the afternoon to
    [Elgsethytta](http://www.elgsethytta.com/public.aspx?pageid=88995) 
  * End: Friday, September 18, 18:00

* Please install GAP on your laptop _before_ arriving to the school.
Please visit the ["Downloading and Installation" page](http://www.gap-system.org/Download/index.html).

* If you are interested in HPC-GAP (High Performance Computing GAP)
please try to get it installed and working on your laptop
_before_ arriving at the school.
To do so, we suggest following [Reimer's build guide](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/wiki/Building-HPC-GAP).
If you encounter any difficulties, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues)
to report your problem (please include OS version, compiler version, ...).

* The third talk about homalg/CAP will be an interactive hands-on session.
If you are interested in this, please download the latest version of the
[CAP project](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project).
