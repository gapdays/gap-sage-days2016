**TRAVEL UPDATE:** The [Forth Road Bridge](https://www.forthroadbridge.org/) is currently closed 
[at least until new year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-35001277). 
If you travel via Edinburgh, we recommend to take a train to Leuchars, but please
allow extra time for your journey as trains are expected to be busier than usually.
See [this ScotRail page](http://www.scotrail.co.uk/frb) for further updates. 

## GAP and Sage Days in general

[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/) Days are meetings where developers and users
with GAP programming experience are invited to influence the future
development of GAP. To streamline each meeting the organizers usually suggest a few
main topics to work on during the week (see e.g. the links to previous GAP days below).

The meetings are also suitable for advertising recent developments in core GAP
and packages via short talks. However, the focus of the meeting is on code
development, with talks only playing a minor role.
As enough GAP experts will be around for technical support, the
meetings offer good opportunities for people to work on their own
packages. At the end of the week, we would be happy to hear about any progress you made.

Sage Days are gatherings of people interested in [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/), 
from newcomers to contributors. Sage Days are organized by a wide range of people around 
the globe. You may find the list of previous Sage Days [here](http://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops).

## {{ site.title }}

For the 1st Joint GAP-Sage Days, the focus of the workshop will be on improving GAP-SageMath integration 
and interaction between our systems and their developers. The focus of the
GAP Coding Sprint will be on converging GAP and HPC-GAP development branches.

More detailed information can be found on [the program page]({{ site.baseurl }}/program).

## Registering and stay

The workshop will take place at the University of St Andrews. Information about the
exact location and accommodation options
