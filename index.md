# Third [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/) Days
## {{ site.description }}<br> {{ site.location }}

The first week of the 3rd GAP Days is a school on representation
theory of algebras and homological algebra in GAP. The talks will
provide a general introduction to programming in GAP and an
introduction to parallel programming in GAP, and introductions to the
GAP-packages [homalg/CAP](http://homalg.math.rwth-aachen.de/)
(homological algebra and category theory in GAP) and
[QPA](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oyvinso/QPA/) (Quivers and Path
Algebras).

The school will be followed by a coding sprint to mutally integrate
the GAP-packages homalg/CAP and QPA. It will end on Wednesday the 23rd at
13:00.

#### GAP Days in general

[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/) Days are meetings where developers and users
with GAP programming experience are invited to influence the future
development of GAP by initiating and contributing to discussions and coding
sprints. As enough GAP experts will be around for technical support, the
meetings usually offer good opportunities for people to work on their own
packages. To streamline each meeting the organizers will usually suggest a few
main topics to work on during the week.

The meetings are also suitable for advertising recent developments in core GAP
and packages via short talks. However, the focus of the meeting is on code
development, with talks only playing a minor role. At the end of the week, we
would be happy to hear about any progress you made.
