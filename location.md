The first joint GAP-Sage Days will take place in
[Trondheim](http://www.trondheim.no/engelsk/) at the
[Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.ntnu.edu/imf), in
[room G144](http://s.mazemap.com/1RvAr1E).

You can find the organizers in room [854 SBII](http://s.mazemap.com/1HfrWqg).

<h3>Accommodation</h3>

All participants will be accommodated in
[Scandic Bakklandet](http://www.scandichotels.com/Hotels/Norway/Trondheim/Bakklandet/).
If you fly to Trondheim, then the easiest way to get to Trondheim from
the airport is to take one of the airport bus services
[Flybussen](http://www.flybussen.no/en/Trondheim/) or
[Værnesekspressen](http://vaernesekspressen.no/index.php/vaernes_eng/vaernes/nyheter).
The most convenient one is the latter, as the bus stop Bakkegata is
directly outside the hotel.  The closest bus stop for Flybussen is
Søndre gt.  Remember to buy a return ticket as this
is cheaper.

It takes
about 22 minutes to walk from the hotel to the university following
