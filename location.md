<h3>Accommodation</h3>

One of the options is to try the brand new [St Andrews Premier Inn Hotel](http://www.premierinn.com/en/hotel/STALAR/st-andrews) just opened in September 2015. At the moment it offers rooms from £39 per night in Premier Saver tariff (Pre-pay, no amends or refunds) and from £55 per night in Premier Flexible tariff (Amend up to 1pm on arrival days). This hotel is located in the southern part of St Andrews and is in 25 minutes walk from the School of Computer Science. If you would like to stay there, please make your own arrangements for the booking.

Alternatively, you may ask the organisers to find a place in some B&B. Prices may vary between different B&B. For example, we have offers for single rooms with shared downstairs shower facilities at £35 per night; single en suite at £45 per night; double/twin room at £85 per night (£65 per night for single occupancy). If you would like the organisers to book a B&B for you, please specify your preferences during registration.
