This is the website for the [GAP days](http://gapdays.de/gap-sage-days2016).

It is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator,
and the [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde/) template.

If you want to test site on your own machine, first install Jekyll (as
described on its website), then do this:
```
  git clone https://github.com/gapdays/gap-sage-days2016
  jekyll serve -w
```
Now open a browser on http://localhost:4000/ to see a live preview
of the site.
